The repo is structured as below:
```
/**
 * Of course al WP files are under this folder.
 * You should consider my functions.php file under my-theme/
 * Because it has some usefull functions inside.
 */
wordpress/

/**
 * And nuxt files are under this folder.
 */
nuxt/

```

### By the time I'm creating this repo [WP is at version 5.4](https://wordpress.org/download/) <br/>
The only reason I created the proper `wordpress/` repo is because I've put my custom theme which is required for the purpose of this demo.

## You can find a [demo here](http://mattiazanella.it/develop/wordpress-nuxt/) ðŸ–¥

#### But how you deploy your environment it's up to you.
